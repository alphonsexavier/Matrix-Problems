# Matrix-Problems

Problem Statement
Consider a matrix A of size Rnd×nd, where each non-overlapping d×d block of the matrix, Dij, is a diagonal matrix. So the matrix consists of n2 such blocks. An example of such a matrix is shown below:

Construct an efficient data structure to represent such matrices and devise algorithms to perform matrix operations, such as matrix multiplications and matrix inverse, on the data structure you designed. Provide a technical write-up of your solution along with associated code implementing your solution.
